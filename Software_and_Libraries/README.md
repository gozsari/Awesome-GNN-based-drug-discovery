# Software and Libraries (GNN)

### 1- PyTorch Geometric (PyG)
* A library for deep learning on irregular input data such as graphs, point clouds, and manifolds, built on top of PyTorch.
* GitHub: https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric
* Tutorial: https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

### 2- Deep Graph Library (DGL)
* A Python package built on top of various deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet) for training and deploying graph neural networks.
* GitHub: https://github.com/dmlc/dgl
* Tutorial: https://docs.dgl.ai/en/latest/tutorials/index.html

### 3- Spektral
* A graph deep learning library based on TensorFlow and Keras.

* Tutorial: https://graphneural.network/

### 4- Graph Nets
* A TensorFlow-based library for building graph networks, developed by DeepMind.
* GitHub: https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets

### 5- StellarGraph
* A Python library for machine learning on graphs and networks, built on top of TensorFlow 2.x and Keras.
* GitHub: https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph
* Tutorial: https://stellargraph.readthedocs.io/en/stable/README.html

### 6- PyTorch BigGraph (PBG)
* A distributed system for learning graph embeddings for large graphs, particularly big web interaction graphs with up to billions of entities and trillions of edges, developed by Facebook.
* GitHub: https://github.com/facebookresearch/PyTorch-BigGraph
* Tutorial: https://pytorchbiggraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### 7- CogDL
* A graph representation learning toolkit that provides a unified interface for various GNN models and heterogeneous graph learning tasks, built on top of PyTorch.
* GitHub: https://github.com/THUDM/cogdl
* Website: https://cogdl.ai/

### 8- PyTorch Geometric Temporal (PyGT)
* A library for temporal graph deep learning, built on top of PyTorch Geometric.
* GitHub: https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/pytorch_geometric_temporal
* Tutorial: https://pytorch-geometric-temporal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

### 9- Dive into Graphs
* DIG differs from popular graph deep learning libraries like PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) by focusing on higher-level, research-oriented tasks such as graph generation, self-supervised learning, explainability, 3D graphs, and graph out-of-distribution. In contrast, PyG and DGL primarily support basic graph deep learning operations.
