### 8- PyTorch Geometric Temporal (PyGT)
* A library for temporal graph deep learning, built on top of PyTorch Geometric.
* GitHub: https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/pytorch_geometric_temporal
* Tutorial: https://pytorch-geometric-temporal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

### 9- Dive into Graphs
* DIG differs from popular graph deep learning libraries like PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) by focusing on higher-level, research-oriented tasks such as graph generation, self-supervised learning, explainability, 3D graphs, and graph out-of-distribution. In contrast, PyG and DGL primarily support basic graph deep learning operations.
