# Awesome-GNN-based-drug-discovery
This is a curated list of resources and tools related to using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery. GNNs are a powerful class of machine learning models that can operate on graph-structured data, which makes them especially well-suited for analyzing molecules and molecular interactions.

This repository aims to provide an overview of the latest developments in GNN-based drug discovery, including:

- **[Research papers:](Research_Papers)** A selection of recent papers on GNNs for molecular property prediction, ligand-based virtual screening, and other drug discovery tasks.

- **Datasets:** Collections of molecular data suitable for training and evaluating GNN models, such as the MoleculeNet benchmark dataset.

- **[Software and libraries:](Software_and_Libraries)** Tools for building and training GNN models for drug discovery, including popular libraries like PyTorch Geometric, DeepChem, and RDKit.

- **Applications:** Examples of GNN-based drug discovery applications, such as predicting binding affinities, identifying novel drug targets, and exploring chemical space.

- **[Tutorials and Courses:](Tutorials_and_Courses)** Resources for learning about GNNs and their application to drug discovery, including online courses and tutorials.

The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive starting point for researchers and practitioners interested in using GNNs for drug discovery. We welcome contributions and suggestions for additional resources to include.
